  - entertainment
  - travel
  - transport
  - restaurants
  - house

- If you recognized any of the categories above, chose the best matched and add to the final response as a single word after a comma.

- If you were not able to recognize the category, use 'other'.

## Date Recognition

When analyzing an image for the receipt data, try to find a date (without time) on which the operation took place.
If you were not able to determine the date, return null.

## Final Response

The final response should contain ONLY the numeric value, a category from the list from above, and a date. All separated by commas.
